    Ondewo NLU Client Node.js
  </h1>
</p>

This package contains a grpc client used to access and communicate the ondewo nlu api.
It was also configured as npm package, so it can be easily added to any Node.js project.
Should be used in combination with "@grpc/grpc-js" and not "grpc" npm package.

## How to install?

**Run:**
```bash
git+https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-nlu-client-nodejs.git
```
inside your project to install the npm package of this github repository in you angular project.

Note: The npm package repository is not supported yet, but will be in the future to make it even easier to install the client.
